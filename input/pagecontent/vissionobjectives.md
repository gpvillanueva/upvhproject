As the Department of Health moves towards a national action plan on viral hepatitis, one of the key elements would be the monitoring and evaluation of the program to assess if the targets set by the WHO are being met. This would require that a terminology service be in place that should be incorporated into the electronic medical records that are recognized by the Department of Health.

This project has several components:
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" STYLE= "margin-left:60px">1. Obtain expert consensus on the terminologies related to chronic viral hepatitis through a workshop;</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" STYLE= "margin-left:60px">2. Populate a terminology service with the consensus terminology </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" STYLE= "margin-left:60px">3. Map EMR terms to the terminology service</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" STYLE= "margin-left:60px">4. Collect data from EMRs into a monitoring dashboard</p>
</p>

At the end of the project, the DOH hepatitis program will have a dashboard that shows standardized data from participating electronic medical records.
